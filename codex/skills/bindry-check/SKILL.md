name: bindry-check
description: Report which compiled Bindry skills are stale, without changing anything. Use when the user asks to check for drift, staleness, or whether their Bindry skills are up to date.
---

Check whether the skills already compiled by the `bindry-sync` skill in this project have fallen behind the
Bindry Stack they came from. This is read-only — it never edits, deletes, or re-syncs a skill, only reports.
Invoke explicitly with `$bindry-check`, or let it trigger automatically when the user asks about drift/staleness.

1. This needs `bindry.config.json` in the project root (written by a previous sync) to know which Stack, API
   base to check against. If it's missing, tell the user to use the `bindry-sync` skill at least once first,
   then stop.
2. For a private Stack, also need `--token <api-key>` (generated from the workspace's team page in Bindry, not
   Account settings) or the `BINDRY_API_TOKEN` environment variable — same requirement as `bindry-sync`.
3. Locate this plugin's own installed root first (e.g. list installed Codex plugins and find the path for
   `bindry@<marketplace>`), then run:
   `node <resolved-plugin-root>/scripts/check-drift.mjs [--dir .agents/skills] [--api-base <url>] [--token <api-key>]`
   If you can't locate `scripts/check-drift.mjs` under this plugin's installed root, stop and say so plainly
   rather than guessing a path.
4. Report exactly what it printed: which skills are up to date, which are stale (and at what version each side
   is), which are **live** (compiled with `--mode live` — always current by design, calls the MCP server
   directly, never goes stale), and which it couldn't check (no pin or live comment, e.g. a hand-authored
   skill, or a Binding no longer in the Stack). If it failed with an authentication error, say so plainly
   rather than retry or guess.
5. If this project is pinned to a Stack version, the report ends with one of two lines, and they mean
   different things. "pinned to X, which is the newest published version" means there is nothing to do.
   "pinned to X; the Stack has since published Y" is **not** staleness — the project is deliberately not
   following the Stack. Relay it as information, and do not suggest re-syncing unless the user says they want
   to move off the pin.
6. If anything is stale, tell the user to use the `bindry-sync` skill to update it — this skill never does that
   for them. Live skills never need this — don't suggest re-syncing them just because they showed up in the
   report.

Note on "how far behind": the API doesn't expose full version history for a Binding today, only its current
pinned version, so the report names the two version strings on each side (e.g. "compiled at 1.0.0, Stack now
pins 2.0.0") rather than a version count. Don't invent a count if asked — say this isn't available yet.
